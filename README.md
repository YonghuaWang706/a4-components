I originally work on a3 to transfer it into react but there are so many bugs. Therefore I have to try to focus on the essential functionality to work: to be able to add a expense.
However, ths click callback seems to be not correctly trigger or binded to the button. I have review the guide and make adjust but still don't quite work.
# did the new technology improve or hinder the development experience?

Instead of React, I prefer Vue as a progressive framework to work with. This gives much more flexibility with existing JS code and paradigm. However, admitedly, framework save a lot of time
from populating/recreating HTML element. This gives much more flexibility to reuse code.
